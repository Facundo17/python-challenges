"""
Create a program that reads a list of motivational quotes from a text file and selects one to display every Monday (or any day the user runs the program). 
It uses Python's date handling to check the current day and ensures youâ€™re greeted with a new quote each time you run it.

The program checks what day it is. 
If it is Monday it displays the day and picks a random quote from the "quotes.txt" file.
If it is not Monday, it simply informs the user the day.

Required Libraries: random, datetime
